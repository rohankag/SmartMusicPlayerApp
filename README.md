# SmartMusicPlayerApp

To build a music application on Android. This application will parse the genre attribute of the music(mp3) files and modifies the user interface accordingly. Integrate accelerometer and proximity sensor data to regulate the flash lights and screen brightness. Also the application will be featuring song suggestion based on user history and the suggestions will be automatically played in case of no user interaction. The application will also provide feature to enable or disable auto play. 

We are planning to use different sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope and proximity sensor to detect user activity. We’ll need a SQLite database to store user’s data. An open source music player API will be used to play the music and fetch the attributes. We will be using android activities for showing user interfaces and background services to fetch data from the sensors and make application respond accordingly.
